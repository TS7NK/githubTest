Front-end role
Works on all parts of a website or web app that users will interact with. This can be anything from the style colors, buttons, menus, or user interactions as they click swipe, and interact with the site. HTML, CSS, and javascript, for example, suppose you are a front-end developer assigned the task of adding a newsletter and sign-up option to the home page of a website. In this case, you would use HTML to build the display elements such as the input area for the user to type their email address and then the button to click to send it. You can then use CSS to position, color, and style these elements on the page. And finally, you can use javascript to process the activity when the user clicks the button.
Back-end role
Back-end developers are responsible for creating and maintaining functionality when users request information or when the website needs to communicate with another part of the web architecture. For processing, for example, performing an account, logging in, or completing an online purchase using a credit card. A back-end developer will facilitate the interaction between the website and the content stored in a database. As a result, back-end development requires different languages, skills, and tools. 
Full-stack role
Full-stack developers have skills and knowledge in all areas of the web development project cycle. For example, they have relevant expertise in the planning architecture, design, development, deployment, and maintenance of the website or web.
